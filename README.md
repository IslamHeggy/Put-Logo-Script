# Put-Logo-Script

This simple script was made to help the Art work team in OSC to put the logo on more than one picture during events.

# How to use from the CLI.
* Execute the script
```
	$ ./Putlogo
```

* Input the logo's Path and name
```
	$ /home/Pictures/logo.png
	or
	$ ../../Pictures/logo.png
```

* Input the photos containing folder's path
```
	$ /home/Pictures/
	or
	$ ../../Pictures/
```

# How to use the GUI.
* Execute the script
```
	$ ./PutlogoGUI.sh
```

Or just double click on the file.

* Follow the on-screen dialogs to get your logo put on the pictures.

### Note:
##### Do not use path with folder or file name that has spaces, this also applies to the GUI.
